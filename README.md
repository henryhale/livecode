## Demo

## Why?

I needed an offline tool to quickly learn and test front-end code (the basics). There are many code playgrounds online that offer much more but I intended to create a minimal, zero-config and easy to use playground.

If you need a more fully fledged online code playground, try;

- [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io)
